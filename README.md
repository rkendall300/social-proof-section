## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This project was pretty relaxing to do compared to my most recent one, the base apparel coming soon page. Having an idea of how the desktop would work as a grid display definitely helped a lot, so I'm thankful I did the other one before this. Definitely getting more confident with page layouts!
